# engine.aar

Gitignored, because it is a 2MB binary — so this file records what the
checked-out tree expects, and `tools/check_engine_parity.sh` verifies the
built artefact against the live league before a release.

| | |
|---|---|
| engine version | **4.42** |
| built from | `autobattle.online` commit `4c08d55` (`Engine v4.42: turn counters`) |
| built on | 2026-10-18 |
| built by | `shell/engine/build_aar.sh`, extracted with `git archive` so the main repo is never touched |

## Build it from the engine source at the version the league scores with

```sh
cd /path/to/autobattle.online
git archive <commit> shell/engine | tar -x -C /tmp/eng
cd /tmp/eng/shell/engine && bash build_aar.sh engine.aar
```

**Do not build from HEAD without checking.** On 2026-10-18 HEAD was
`Engine v4.43 ... BUILT, NOT DEPLOYED` — shipping it would have put players
on an engine *ahead* of the one scoring them, which is the same fault as a
stale AAR in the other direction. The target is whatever
`validate_linux_amd64 --version` reports on subgames-nyc1.
