# engine.aar

Gitignored, because it is a 2MB binary — so this file records what the
checked-out tree expects, and `tools/check_engine_parity.sh` verifies the
built artefact against the live league before a release.

| | |
|---|---|
| engine version | **4.49** |
| built from | `autobattle.online` commit `5ff860f` (engine identical to `84c5988`, `Engine v4.49: amplify_dishonor`) |
| built on | 2026-10-25 |
| built by | `shell/engine/build_aar.sh`, extracted with `git archive` so the main repo is never touched |

## Build it from the engine source at the version the league scores with

```sh
cd /path/to/autobattle.online
git archive <commit> shell/engine | tar -x -C /tmp/eng
cd /tmp/eng/shell/engine && bash build_aar.sh engine.aar
```

**Do not build from HEAD without checking.** On 2026-10-18 HEAD was
`Engine v4.43 ... BUILT, NOT DEPLOYED` — shipping it would have put players
on an engine *ahead* of the one scoring them, which is the same fault as a
stale AAR in the other direction. The target is whatever
`validate_linux_amd64 --version` reports on subgames-nyc1.

**It moves under you.** Between the morning and the evening of 2026-10-18
the league went 4.42 → 4.44, and the only reason the release did not ship a
stale engine is that `tools/check_engine_parity.sh` runs before the bundle.
Run it every time; the gap opens silently.
